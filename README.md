# GRIPLOCK Mobile

Mobile companion app for the GRIPLOCK non-custodial wallet system.

## Overview

GRIPLOCK Mobile is a companion application used to authorize and verify wallet sessions within the GRIPLOCK ecosystem.

The app works alongside the GRIPLOCK dashboard to enable secure, user-initiated wallet access using physical NFC interaction and local authentication.

GRIPLOCK Mobile does **not store wallets, private keys, or balances**.  
Wallet material is derived locally and exists only for the duration of an active session.

## Core Principles

- Non-custodial by design
- User-initiated access only
- No persistent private key storage
- Physical presence required via NFC

## Features

- QR code scanning to connect with GRIPLOCK dashboard
- NFC card interaction using standard NFC hardware
- Local PIN verification with attempt limiting
- Encrypted session communication
- Session-based wallet authorization
- Minimal surface area by design

## Tech Stack

- React Native with Expo
- React Navigation
- @noble cryptography libraries
- WebSocket-based session communication

## Security Model

- Wallet material is derived locally and kept in memory only
- No seed phrases are stored or transmitted
- PIN attempts are rate-limited per session
- Session lockout is enforced after repeated failures
- No backend service stores sensitive user data

GRIPLOCK Mobile acts strictly as a **verification and authorization layer**, not a custodial wallet.

## How It Works

1. User scans a QR code generated by the GRIPLOCK dashboard
2. A secure session channel is established
3. User taps an NFC card to confirm physical intent
4. User enters a PIN locally
5. Wallet credentials are derived and used only for the active session
6. Session data is transmitted securely to the dashboard

All cryptographic operations occur client-side.

## Requirements

- Android device with NFC support
- NFC card compatible with GRIPLOCK
- Active connection to the GRIPLOCK dashboard

## Notes

- This application does not provide recovery mechanisms
- Loss of NFC card or PIN may result in loss of access
- GRIPLOCK Mobile is intended for users familiar with non-custodial systems
